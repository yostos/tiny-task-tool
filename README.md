# ttt (Tiny Task Tool)

A minimal TUI task manager for the terminal.

**Status:** Work in Progress

## Philosophy

- **One sheet of paper** - One file, no folders, no decisions
- **Focus on today** - No searching, no past data
- **Unix philosophy** - Edit with your favorite editor ($EDITOR)

## Inspiration

This project is inspired by:

- [ephe](https://github.com/unvalley/ephe) - "One clean page to focus your day"
- [aeph](https://github.com/siki-712/aeph) - CLI markdown editor inspired by ephe

I was impressed by aeph's approach of bringing the experience to the command line. However, I felt that these tools had drifted from the original "one sheet of paper" philosophy. This tool is my attempt to stay true to that core principle: one file, no choices, no distractions.

## Usage

```bash
ttt                    # Launch TUI
ttt -t buy milk        # Add task quickly
ttt --help             # Show help
```

## Requirements

- Go 1.21+
